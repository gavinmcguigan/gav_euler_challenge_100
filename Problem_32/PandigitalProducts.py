    We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for 
    example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

    The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product 
    is 1 through 9 pandigital.
    
    Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 
    9 pandigital.
    
    HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.
